Because we do not have depth-invariant strains or strain rates, I propose the modified definitions\n",

    "For $\\psi_e$, let $\\lambda_1^e < \\lambda_2^e$ represent the first and second eigenvalues of $-\\nabla^2\\eta$ (i.e., the $\\zeta$-invariant part of $\\varepsilon$). Then $\\lambda_1^e\\zeta$ and $\\lambda_2^e\\zeta$ are eigenvalues of $\\varepsilon = -\\nabla^2\\eta\\zeta$, with the larger of the two determined by the sign of $\\zeta$. Specifically, $\\varepsilon_1 = \\lambda_1^e\\zeta$ when $\\zeta$ is positive, and $\\lambda_2^e\\zeta$ when $\\zeta$ is negative. We can now break $\\psi_e$ up into its lower and upper components, writing:\n",
