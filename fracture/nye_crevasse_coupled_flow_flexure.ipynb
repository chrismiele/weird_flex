    "The Nye zero-stress crevasse depth criterion states that crevasses penetrate to the depth at which the principal tension (the first eigenvalue of $\\tau$) is equal to the pressure.

    "Beginning with these crevasse depth laws, I'll derive expressions for both surface and basal crevasse depths from flexure. But first we need to look at the conditions under which this form of crevasse law makes sense:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the question \"How deep can a crevasse reach before it encounters pressure sufficient to halt it?\" is not automatically well-posed. For a surface crevasse, the question assumes that the vertical gradient of the pressure outpaces that of the principal tension; i.e., $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\zeta}P_i < \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\zeta}(\\tau_\\nu^*\\zeta)'$ (note that $\\zeta$ is elevation, rather than depth). If this condition is not met, crevasse depths may be negative (as when conditions at the surface permit crevasse formation, but pressure decreases in the *upward* direction) or even infinite (when the principal tension and the pressure change with depth at the same rate). To see when the condition for positive, finite crevasse depths will be met, let $\\lambda_1 < \\lambda_2$ represent the first and second eigenvalues of $\\tau_\\nu^*$. Then $\\tau_\\nu^*\\zeta$ has eigenvalues $\\lambda_1\\zeta$ and $\\lambda_2\\zeta$, with the larger of the two determined by the sign of $\\zeta$. Without loss of generality, let's work in the top half of the shelf, so that $\\zeta > 0$ and $\\lambda_1\\zeta$ is the first eigenvalue of $\\tau_\\nu^*\\zeta$. Then $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\zeta}(\\tau_\\nu^*\\zeta)' = \\lambda_1$, and the condition for well-behaved crevasses is that $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\zeta}P_i < \\lambda_1$. From our prior expression for $P_i$, **the surface crevasse depth law above is applicable as long as** $\\lambda_{1, 2} + tr(\\tau_\\nu^*) + \\rho_ig > 0$. The corresponding condition for basal crevasses is that $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\zeta}P_i < \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\zeta}(\\tau_\\nu^*\\zeta)' - \\rho_{sw}g$. Following similar reasoning, this ultimately results in the condition that, **to permit the calculation of basal crevasse depths by the equations above, we must have** $\\lambda_{1, 2} + tr(\\tau_\\nu^*) + (\\rho_i - \\rho_{sw})g > 0.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where these requirements are violated, it is probably most appropriate to assume that surface crevasses simply reach the base, and basal crevasses reach the surface. These caveats will be used as conditionals on the solutions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Surface crevasses from flexure\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the crevasse depth $d$ so that $\\zeta_c = \\frac{H}{2} - d$. Suppose that the principal tension from flexure at the surface is greater than the pressure, so that $P_i|_{surf} < \\lambda_1\\frac{H}{2}$ (i.e., conditions at the surface are conducive to crevassing). Expressing the surface crevasse law in terms of $d$, and bearing in mind the caveats discussed above, we will have crevasses reaching the depth at which\n",

    "\n",
    "To evaluate the left-hand side of this equality, consider two cases: either the crevasse tip lies above the vertical midpoint of the shelf, or the crevasse tip lies below the vertical midpoint of the shelf. If it is the former, then $\\zeta_c > 0$; since $\\lambda_1 > \\lambda_2$ by definition, we may conclude that $\\lambda_1\\zeta_c > \\lambda_2\\zeta_c$. This guarantees that the principal tension at the crevasse tip is $(\\tau_\\nu^*\\zeta_c)' = \\lambda_1\\zeta_c = \\lambda_1\\left(\\frac{H}{2} - d\\right)$. Conversely, if the crevasse tip lies below the shelf's midpoint, then $\\zeta_c < 0$, and the principal tension at the crevasse tip is $(\\tau_\\nu^*\\zeta_c)' = \\lambda_2\\zeta_c = \\lambda_2\\left(\\frac{H}{2} - d\\right)$.
